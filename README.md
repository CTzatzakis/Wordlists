# Wordlists

A sample set of word lists or dictionaries for testing against a dictionary attack.

### Audience
This is for those who are willing to put their security to the test or need a starting set of a wordlist to start with.

## Definition
In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary.

### Technique
A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing, typically derived from a list of words such as in a dictionary. In contrast to a brute force attack, where a large proportion of the key space is searched systematically, a dictionary attack tries only those possibilities which are deemed most likely to succeed. Dictionary attacks often succeed because many people have a tendency to choose short passwords that are ordinary words or common passwords, or simple variants obtained, for example, by appending a digit or punctuation character. Dictionary attacks are relatively easy to defeat, e.g. by using a passphrase or otherwise choosing a password that is not a simple variant of a word found in any dictionary or listing of commonly used passwords.
